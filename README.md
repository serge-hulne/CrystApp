# CrystApp

# Webview apps written in Crystal
- Self-contained.
- Single file, statically compiled.
- Easy to distribute.

# In short:
- "Wails for Crystal".
- "Electron for Crystal.

(The alpha version uses a Makefile as CLI for the moment)

# TODO
- Add support for Svelte (it also provides a dev server for client side).
- in dev phase, switch to Svelte dev server port (bypass Crystal server).
- Check interoperability Crystal <-> JavaScript/TypeScript. Provide examples.
- Make determination of port automatic.
- Disable "Reload" in "release" mode
- Create example apps on separate Git repo's.
